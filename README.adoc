= Plugin Generator

This repository contains the  Plugin generator application for RHQ[http://jboss.org/rhq/].
The generator is a standalone application that can be used to create initial skeletons
of a(n agent) plugin for RHQ. The generator creates all the artifacts like
Maven `pom.xml`, the plugigin component and discovery classes as well as the
plugin descriptor `rhq-plugin.xml`.

The generator can be run as a command line tool or via a JavaFX-UI.
The later also allows to scan existing classes for annotations that describe
metrics and operations.
